    postText:'Before HiGeorge, Advocate rarely used data visualizations. When they did, it was generally only if there were several months of lead time. Jehadu Abshiro, the Publisher at Advocate, states that they, like many small newsrooms, “simply did not have the bandwidth to create compelling, effective, and user-friendly data visualizations.”',

    graphText: 'Transitioning to using HiGeorge was a smooth and seamless process for Advocate. Jehadu notes that “the team is easy to work with and quick to respond, while the visualizations themselves are also quick to implement and compatible with a variety of content management systems.”',
    deployment: 'With HiGeorge',
    deploymentText: 'Now, accessing data is much simpler for Advocate. Jehadu says they are now able to provide the same information to their readers as some bigger publications who actually have data scientists and designers on staff.',

    postText: 'Denise Lockwood, owner and publisher of the Racine County Eye, did “a ton of manual work and would spend hours working on COVID data coverage, limiting the number of articles that had data.” Although she tried to use data viz software, none of them came with the necessary datasets. This presented challenges: daily updates were inefficient, and Denise “didn’t have confidence in the data’s integrity.”',
    graph: 'With HiGeorge',
    graphText: 'Denise can now focus on reporting about the context surrounding the numbers, rather than the numbers themselves. She believes this has made a huge difference in the reader experience, as the combination of HiGeorge’s visualizations and her explanations are able to “crystallize understanding of certain stories for readers.”',
    deployment: 'HiGeorge’s Impact',
    deploymentText: 'Visualizations automatically update every day, so there is no need for any manual work from the team at Racine County Eye. Denise feels that HiGeorge has alleviated a major pain point, saying: “Quite frankly, I wouldn’t have used nearly as much data content in my reporting without HiGeorge.”',
