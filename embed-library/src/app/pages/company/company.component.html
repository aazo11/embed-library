            We specifically designed HiGeorge for newsrooms that want an easy way to
            supplement a wide array of articles with rich data interactives.
            HiGeorge maximizes time spent on site and translates
            this increased engagement into monetization opportunities
            for publishers by allowing readers to take actions directly
            from the visualization without leaving the site.
